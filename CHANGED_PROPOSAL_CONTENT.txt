1. System requirenments gathering
	Gather the application requirements according to the system needs.
2. Study about websockets and its behaviour
	A study on websockets must be performed since it is a stateful protocol unlike http (since http is a stateless protocol).
3. Design the server side architecture
	According to the needs a proper server side architecture must be designed.
4. Design application logic and Data Models
	Identifying the logical flow of features and functinalities of the whole application.
4. Interface design
	Design the user interface.
5. System Implementation
	Start developing the system from the ground up.
6. System testing
	Test the system continuously.


METHODOLOGY
So to achieve this a new system will be developed from scratch. Before implement the system a study on websockets must be performed. Since websockets are stateful (Not like regular HTTP protocol which is stateless), on the server side it is difficult to handle websockets. So we should identify a proper architecture to manage websockets on the server so that it will benefit in various circumstances such as scaling. Once a mechanism is found to handle websockets on the server the server implementation can be started. Once the websocket server is established then according to the application logic data models should be designed. Then the User Interface should be designed. And finally the system can be implemented. Along the way sometimes the application logic will change according to some requirement changes.
